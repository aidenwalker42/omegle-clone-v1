        Welcome to my Omegle Clone! This website was made by using a combination
        of web sockets and webRTC to establish a connection between two people,
        the source code can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/aidenwalker42/omegle-clone-v1">here.</a>

        <b>
          Video chat requires you to have a media device connected, also mobile
          is not supported currently.</b
        >
        If you are having trouble connecting to your webcam make sure your
        browser is not blocking access to media devices. There are known issues
        with Microsoft Edge and Firefox with media devices as well (Chrome works
        best) also make sure your connection is secure (https). If you do not
        have a webcam feel free to join the text only chat!
